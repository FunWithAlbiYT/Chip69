# Chip69
An emulator for a device that... doesnt exist?

### Emulating
Before being able to emulate, you must have
these requirements:
- Python >= 3.8

After those are installed then you can
emulate doing this:
`$ python main.py rom.ch69`
replace \`rom.ch69\` with the filename of your
rom that must be located in the /roms/ folder

### Assembling
I'm not going to teach you how to code x69 assembly
but I am going to show you how to assemble your code
if you have written it.

If you want to learn look at the \`code.asm\` file in the which uses all functions implemented
into Chip69

Alright, lets start.
Make sure you have the requirements, they're listed in the [Emulating](#Emulating) section before starting.

This is the code on assembling:
`$ python assembler.py code.asm`
replace \`code.asm\` with the filename of your assembly
code.
